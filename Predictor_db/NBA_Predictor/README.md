This is my newest version of the nba predictor, now equipted with multiple predictors, and many new features!

This includes functions to update a database based on the performance of each model. Each pick for winners and for spreads is recorded for every game of the 2022-23 nba season.

Also included is a flask server, with a plaintext webpage to display the picks for any given day, as well as the current record for each model.

To update the database and generate the predictions for the day, run 'autorun.py'.
To veiw the webpage, type 'py server.py' into the terminal
